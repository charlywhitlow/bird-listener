                <p>
                    Birds are more often heard than seen, so knowing the sounds they make can open up a hidden world of birds all around us,
                    adding depths of familiarity and understanding to a walk any place where there are birds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This app hopes to help you build and practice your knowledge of UK bird songs and calls, so you can start identifying birds by sound.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A couple of great books I'd recommend reading alongside the app are <a href="https://www.simonbarnesauthor.co.uk/books/birdwatching-with-your-eyes-closed/" target="_blank">Birdwatching with your Eyes Closed</a> by Simon Barnes, 
                    and <a href="https://shopping.rspb.org.uk/bird-reference-books/rspb-guide-to-birdsong-with-cd.html" target="_blank">RSPB Guide to Bird Song</a> by Adrian Thomas.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A good guide can help you pick out differences between different songs, and offer general tips for identifying birds by sounds.
