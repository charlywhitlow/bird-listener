                <p>
                    Listening to the birds has given me much personal joy over the years. 
                    This app has been created to enable users to build and practice their knowledge of bird songs and calls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Birds are more often heard than seen, and knowing the sounds they make can open up a hidden world of birds all around us,
                    adding depths of familiarity and understanding to a walk any place where there are birds.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I owe a huge debt to the <a href="https://www.xeno-canto.org/">Xeno-Canto</a> website and commnity, where people all over the world share their bird recordings.
                    Similarly all images have been sourced from <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Welcome">Wikimedia Commons</a>.
                    Without the community of people creating and sharing their content under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses, 
                    I would not have been able to create this app.
                </p>

                    I also owe a huge personal debt to the author Simon Barnes, whose lovely book <a href="https://www.simonbarnesauthor.co.uk/books/birdwatching-with-your-eyes-closed/">Birdwatching with your Eyes Closed</a>, 
                    first opened my ears to the birds around me. And author Adrian Thomas, whose comprehensive <a href="https://shopping.rspb.org.uk/bird-reference-books/rspb-guide-to-birdsong-with-cd.html">RSPB Guide to Bird Song</a>
                    has helped to build and refine my understanding of bird sounds and calls. I wholeheartedly recommend both of these books for anyone who's interested in learning more.
